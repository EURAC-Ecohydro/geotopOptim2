Eco-hydrological models are increasingly used in the contexts of hydrology, ecology, precision agriculture for a detailed description of the water cycle at various scales: local scale, an hillslope or a watershed. However, with increasing computing power and observations avalaible, bigger and bigger amount of raw data are produced. Therefore the need to develop flexible and user-oriented interfaces to visualize multiple outputs, perform sensitivity analyzes and compare against observations emerges.
This work presents two R open-source packages: **geotopbricks** and **geotopOptim2**. They offer an I/0 interface and R visualization tools the GEOtop hydrological distributed model (http://geotopmodel.github.io/geotop/), which  solves water mass and energy budget equations
to describe water cycle in the EarthÂ´s critical zone.
The package  *geotopbricks* (https://github.com/ecor/geotopbricks and https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geotopbricks ) is able to  to read the GEOtop I/O data of the model. The package  *geotopOptim2* (https://github.com/EURAC-Ecohydro/geotopOptim2) calling the **hydroPSO** (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroPSO) package can be used for model calibration against observations.  Further details and complete R package dependencies are listed in *geotopOtim2* description file.  
As a demonstration example, an analysis of modeled  and observed soil moisture and evapotranspiration time series in some alpine agricultural sites (https://github.com/EURAC-Ecohydro/MonaLisa) are presented.

R packages: *geotopbricks,stringr,geotopOptim2(github),hydroPSO,hydroGOF,shiny and leaflet (for visualizion)*
